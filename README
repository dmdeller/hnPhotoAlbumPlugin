Configuration
-------------

0.  Install the plugin and run 'symfony plugin:publish-assets' so your site can find the stylesheets, etc.
    Make sure the sfProtoculousPlugin is enabled if you want AJAXy goodness (of course you do!)


1.  Enable the 'photos' module in your app's settings.yml:

all:
  .settings:
    enabled_modules:        [photos]


2.  Configure some settings in your app's app.yml:

all:
  hnPhotoAlbumPlugin:
    picasa_username:    tester        # change this to your username. 'tester' has a bunch of sample photos.
    
                                      # for valid thumb values, see http://code.google.com/apis/picasaweb/reference.html#Parameters
    album_thumb_size:   160c          # size (width) for album thumbnails. default is 160px, cropped.
    photo_thumb_size:   160u          # size (width) for photo thumbnails. default is 160px, uncropped.
    
    photo_display_size: 800           # maximum size (width) for photos. default is 800px. note, no 'u' or 'c' is needed/allowed here.


3.  Optionally style the output. All of the plugin's HTML is wrapped in a div with the ID 'hnPhotoAlbumPlugin', so you can use that to limit CSS rules to this particular plugin.


4.  <?php echo link_to('photos/index'); ?> somewhere on your site so visitors can find it! :)
